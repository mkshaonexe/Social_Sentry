# Scroll Limiter Fixes - What Was Changed

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Scroll Tracking Not Working
**Problem:** The scroll limiter wasn't triggering even after scrolling for more than 2 minutes on Facebook news feed.

**Root Cause:** 
- The scroll tracking didn't reset properly when users paused scrolling
- No inactivity detection - if user stopped scrolling for a bit, the timer kept running

**Solution:**
- Added inactivity reset: if no scroll detected for 5 seconds, timer resets
- Added `lastFacebookScrollTime` to track continuous scrolling
- Improved logging for debugging (shows duration in seconds)
- Better state management for scroll sessions

### 2. ✅ Toggle Switch Color
**Problem:** The toggle switch was pink/default color instead of matching the app's green theme.

**Solution:**
- Applied the same color scheme as Managed Apps switches
- Green (0xFF4CAF50) when enabled
- Gray (0xFF9E9E9E) when disabled
- Proper disabled state colors

## How the Feature Works Now

### Scroll Detection Logic
1. **User scrolls on Facebook** - Timer starts
2. **Continuous scrolling tracked** - Every scroll event updates the timer
3. **Pause detection** - If user stops scrolling for >5 seconds, timer resets
4. **1 minute threshold** - When continuous scrolling reaches 60 seconds, popup triggers
5. **30-second break** - User cannot use Facebook during popup countdown
6. **Cooldown period** - After popup closes, 1-minute cooldown before next trigger

### Important Notes
- ✅ Works on Facebook news feed (home page scrolling)
- ✅ Works regardless of Reels blocking on/off
- ✅ Must have "Facebook Scroll Limiter" toggle ON in settings
- ✅ Requires Accessibility Service enabled
- ✅ Tracks continuous scrolling only (resets if you pause for 5+ seconds)

## Testing Guide

### Enable the Feature
1. Open Social Sentry app
2. Tap 3-line menu icon (top left) → Settings
3. **Scroll down** to find "Facebook Scroll Limiter" 
4. Toggle it **ON** (should be green)
5. Make sure Accessibility Service is enabled (green checkmark at top)

### Test the Popup
1. Open **Facebook app**
2. Go to **News Feed** (home page with posts)
3. **Scroll continuously** for 1 minute
   - Keep scrolling down through posts
   - Don't pause for more than 5 seconds
4. After 60 seconds, the popup should appear:
   - Full-screen overlay with countdown
   - Cannot use Facebook during 30-second countdown
   - Popup auto-closes after 30 seconds

### Debug/Check Logs
If the popup doesn't appear, check Android logs:
```bash
adb logcat | grep "SocialSentry"
```

Look for these messages:
- "Facebook scroll limiter: Started tracking scroll time"
- "Facebook scroll limiter: Duration = Xs"
- "Facebook scroll limiter: 1 minute threshold reached"
