## 🚀 How It Works

### First-Time User Flow
1. **App Launch**: User opens Social Sentry for the first time
2. **Tutorial Check**: App checks `isFirstTimeUser` and `hasCompletedTutorial`
3. **Tutorial Display**: If both conditions are true, tutorial screen appears
4. **Step Navigation**: User can navigate through 6 tutorial steps
5. **Completion**: User completes tutorial or skips it
6. **State Update**: `hasCompletedTutorial` is set to true, `isFirstTimeUser` to false
7. **Normal Flow**: App continues to main interface

### Tutorial Features
- **Progress Indicator**: Visual dots showing current step
- **Smooth Animations**: Slide transitions between steps
- **Skip Option**: Users can skip tutorial at any time
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Color-Coded Steps**: Each step has its own theme color
