# <footer>

# Type should be one of the following:
# * feat: A new feature
# * fix: A bug fix
# * docs: Documentation only changes
# * style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
# * refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# * perf: A code change that improves performance
# * test: Adding missing tests
# * chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

# Scope should be the area of the codebase affected (e.g., ui, service, data, etc.)

# Subject should be imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# Don't capitalize first letter
# No dot (.) at the end

# Body should include motivation for the change and contrast with previous behavior

# Footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit Closes
