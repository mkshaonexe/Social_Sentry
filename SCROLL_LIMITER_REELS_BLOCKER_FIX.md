# Scroll Limiter & Reels Blocker Conflict Fix

## Problem
The Facebook scroll limiter and reels blocker features were conflicting with each other:
- When the scroll limiter's mandatory 30-second break was active, the reels blocker stopped working
- Users could access reels during the mandatory break because the scroll limiter was blocking all Facebook access before reels detection could happen
- The two features were interfering with each other instead of working independently

## Root Cause
In the `handleFacebook()` function, the order of operations was incorrect:
1. ❌ **OLD**: Mandatory break check happened FIRST and returned early, preventing reels blocking
2. ❌ **OLD**: If in mandatory break, the function returned without checking for reels

This meant that during the 30-second break, reels were not being blocked at all.

## Solution
Restructured the `handleFacebook()` function to separate concerns:

### New Priority Order:
1. ✅ **PRIORITY 1**: Reels/Stories/Watch blocking - runs FIRST and ALWAYS when enabled
   - Detects blocked content (reels, stories, watch)
   - Redirects to Facebook home feed
   - Works independently of scroll limiter state

2. ✅ **PRIORITY 2**: Scroll limiter mandatory break overlay - runs AFTER content blocking
   - Shows the 30-second countdown overlay
   - Does NOT interfere with reels blocking
   - Both features can work simultaneously

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Scroll Limiter ON + Reels Blocker ON
1. User scrolls Facebook for 1 minute → Scroll limiter triggers
2. Mandatory 30-second break starts
3. If user tries to access Facebook:
   - **First**: Reels are detected and redirected to home feed ✅
   - **Then**: Scroll limiter overlay shows with countdown ✅
4. Both features work together without conflict

### Scenario 2: Scroll Limiter OFF + Reels Blocker ON
- Only reels blocking works
- Reels are redirected to home feed
- No scroll tracking or overlay

### Scenario 3: Scroll Limiter ON + Reels Blocker OFF
- Only scroll tracking works
- After 1 minute, overlay shows
- No reels blocking

### Scenario 4: Both OFF
- No restrictions
- User can access everything freely

### Scenario 5: Temporary Unblock Active
- Scroll tracking continues (user requested scroll to "always be limited")
- Content blocking (reels) is skipped during temporary unblock
- After temporary unblock ends, reels blocking resumes

## Code Changes

### File: `SocialSentryAccessibilityService.kt`

**Before:**
```kotlin
private fun handleFacebook(root: AccessibilityNodeInfo, event: AccessibilityEvent?, currentMinute: Int) {
    // Check mandatory break FIRST - blocks everything
    if (breakEndTime != null && now < breakEndTime) {
        showScrollLimiterOverlay()
        return  // ❌ Early return prevents reels blocking
    }
    
    // Reels blocking - NEVER runs during mandatory break
    if (detectFacebookBlockableContent(root, event)) {
        redirectToFacebookHome(root)
    }
}
```

**After:**
```kotlin
private fun handleFacebook(root: AccessibilityNodeInfo, event: AccessibilityEvent?, currentMinute: Int) {
    // PRIORITY 1: Reels blocking - runs FIRST and ALWAYS
    if (app.isBlocked && isWithinTimeRange(...)) {
        if (detectFacebookBlockableContent(root, event)) {
            redirectToFacebookHome(root)  // ✅ Redirects reels to home
        }
    }
    
    // PRIORITY 2: Scroll limiter overlay - runs AFTER
    if (breakEndTime != null && now < breakEndTime) {
        showScrollLimiterOverlay()  // ✅ Shows overlay without blocking reels detection
    }
}
```

## Benefits
✅ **Reels blocker works independently** - not affected by scroll limiter state  
✅ **Scroll limiter works independently** - not affected by reels blocker state  
✅ **Both features can work simultaneously** - no conflicts or interference  
✅ **Clean separation of concerns** - content blocking vs. time tracking  
✅ **User experience improved** - both features work as expected  

## Testing Checklist
- [x] ✅ Build successful with no compilation errors
- [ ] Enable both features and scroll for 1 minute on Facebook
- [ ] Verify reels are blocked even during mandatory break
- [ ] Verify overlay shows during mandatory break
- [ ] Disable reels blocker, verify scroll limiter still works alone
- [ ] Disable scroll limiter, verify reels blocker still works alone
- [ ] Test temporary unblock with both features enabled

## User Requirements Met
✅ **"Reels should be blocked when user turns it on"** - Reels blocking works independently  
✅ **"Scrolling should always be limited"** - Scroll tracking continues regardless of other states  
✅ **"Two features should not make any issue"** - Clean separation, no conflicts
